305 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection



305 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 18 May 2020

1.     As of 18 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed an additional 305 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in
foreign worker dormitories. Two cases are Singaporeans/ Permanent
Residents.

2.     The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests
being processed as one testing laboratory is reviewing its processes
following an earlier apparatus calibration issue, and will need time to
ramp up its testing capacity.

3.     We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
