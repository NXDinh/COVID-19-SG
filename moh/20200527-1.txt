832 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 533 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 27 May 2020

  As of 27 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 533 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

A)  IMPORTED CASES: 0

There are no imported cases today.

B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 4 (3 Singaporeans/Permanent
Residents, 1 Work Pass holder)

The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average
of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 6 per day in the
past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also
increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an
average of 2 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our active
surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school
staff, which have picked up more cases in the past week. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.

C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 529

We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.  Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.
