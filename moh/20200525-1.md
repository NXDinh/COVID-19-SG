    <body><h1>862 More Cases Discharged; 344 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 25 May 2020</p> As of 25 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 344 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests being conducted. The breakdown is as follows:&nbsp;<br><br>a)&nbsp;<strong>Imported cases: 0&nbsp;<br><br></strong>There are no imported cases today.&nbsp;<br><br>b)&nbsp;<strong>Cases in the community: 6 </strong>(4 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 2 Work Permit holders) <br><br>The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our active surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school staff, which have picked up more cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.&nbsp;<br><br>c)&nbsp;<strong>Cases residing in dormitories: 338&nbsp;<br><br></strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;"><br><br></span>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
