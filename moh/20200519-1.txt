No Award of Tender for Site At Gibraltar Cresecent for Dementia Care
Village



NO AWARD OF TENDER FOR SITE AT GIBRALTAR CRESECENT FOR DEMENTIA CARE VILLAGE


Published Date: 19 May 2020

      On behalf of the Ministry of Health, the Urban Redevelopment
Authority announced today that no award was made for the site at
Gibraltar Crescent.
2     The site at Gibraltar Crescent was launched for sale via the
Concept and Price Revenue Tender[1] approach on 16 July 2019 to pilot a
new residential care community concept for individuals with varying
stages of dementia. One of the objectives of the tender was to seek
ideas from the private sector to develop new care options for persons
with dementia to facilitate ageing-in-place.
3     The tender closed on 15 January 2020. One tender submission was
received from Pre 11 Pte. Ltd. and Orpea Singapore Pte. Ltd.
4     The tender has been rejected as the sole price bid of $15,000,000
(details of the price bid are shown in Annex B) offered by Pre 11 Pte.
Ltd. and Orpea Singapore Pte. Ltd. was deemed too low.
5     The Government will continue to review the range of options
available for seniors to age-in-place in the community as well as the
viability of a dedicated residential care option for individuals with
dementia. We will continue to consult public and private sector
stakeholders.

[1] Under the Concept and Price Revenue Tender approach, the concept
proposals would first be evaluated by a Concept Evaluation Committee
against a set of criteria, which included suitability of the proposed
model of care for persons with dementia, as well as the quality of the
care programmes and services (see details in Annex A). Acceptable
concept proposals would proceed to the second stage of the tender
evaluation, where the price envelopes of acceptable concept proposals
would then be opened and evaluated based on price.
