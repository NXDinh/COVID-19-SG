The breakdown is as follows: </p><p><strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imported cases: 0</strong></p><p>There are no imported cases today. </p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases in the community: 5<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</strong>(1 Singaporean, 2 Work Pass holders, 2 Work Permit holders)</p><p>Of the 5 cases in the community, 2 had been picked up as a result of our proactive surveillance and screening, and 2 had already been placed on quarantine. </p><p>All 4 Work Pass/ Work Permit holders are asymptomatic but had been detected due to our proactive screening. Amongst them, 1 (Case 39071) was tested as she works as a security guard at a dormitory at Tampines Street 62. Another (Case 39321) was swabbed as part of our efforts to screen workers in essential services. The other 2 cases (Cases 39013 and 39039) are housemates of previously confirmed cases, and had already been quarantined earlier. They were swabbed during quarantine to verify their status. </p><p>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the Singaporean case (Case 39004). </p><p>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we also conducted serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or past infections.<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>The serological test results of 3 cases (Cases 39039, 39071 and 39321) have come back positive, which indicate likely past infections. Results are pending for the rest. </p><p>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 6 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 8 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our active surveillance and screening of targeted groups, which have picked up more cases in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.</p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 416</strong></p><p>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591971853559000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFA8CfCNeQr230SDrJ_3OCY4fXolg\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/<wbr>situation-report</a>).
