Two cases are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents. </span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;">The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests being processed as one testing laboratory is reviewing its processes following an earlier apparatus calibration issue, and will need time to ramp up its testing capacity.</span></p> <p style="margin-left: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;">We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.</span></p></body>
