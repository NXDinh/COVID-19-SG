1,094 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 465 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 16 May 2020

       As of 16 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 465 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests
being processed as one testing laboratory is reviewing its processes
following an earlier apparatus calibration issue, and will need time to
ramp up its testing capacity. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 5 (4 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 Work
Pass)
The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average
of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per day in the
past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also
decreased, from an average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an
average of 1 per day in the past week.
Most of the community cases today are linked. Two work at migrant worker
dormitories and two are household contacts of one of the cases.
C) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING OUTSIDE DORMITORIES): 3
The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside
dormitories has decreased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the
week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week.
D) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING IN DORMITORIES): 457
We continue to pick up many more cases amongst Work Permit holders
residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories,
because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process
to verify and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex

41 previously unlinked cases.
