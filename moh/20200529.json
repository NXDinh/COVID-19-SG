The breakdown is as follows:<br><br></span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>a)&nbsp;Imported cases: 0</strong></span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><br>There are no imported cases today. </span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><br><strong>b)&nbsp;Cases in the community: 9 </strong>(3 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 2 Work Pass holders, 4 Work Permit holders)</span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><br>Amongst the 3 SC/PR cases today, 2 are linked to dormitory clusters, and had already been placed on quarantine earlier. 1 is currently unlinked. </span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><br>Amongst the 6 Work Pass and Work Permit holders, 5 were picked up as a result of our proactive screening and surveillance. Amongst them, 3 were tested as part of our screening of migrant workers residing at shop-houses located at Balestier Road, due to their proximity to another cluster in the same area. The other 2 were tested before they were due to start work on plumbing/ electrical projects at schools, as a precautionary measure to prepare for the safe re-opening of schools. The remaining case is a contact of earlier cases, and had already been placed on quarantine earlier. </span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 6 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 5 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br></span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>c)&nbsp;Cases residing in dormitories: 602<br></strong><br></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\">We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers. </span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><br>2. &nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

As there have been no more cases linked to Keppel Shipyard (51 Pioneer Sector 1) and 2 Tuas Avenue 10 for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.<br><br></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\">5. &nbsp; &nbsp; We had previously informed that of the preschool staff who have been proactively screened so far, 13 had tested positive using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Of these, 11 were likely to be past infections, based on epidemiological investigations, including their positive serological test results <sup>[1]</sup>. One more serological test has come back positive today. We have assessed that the individual was unlikely to be infectious by the time of the recent screening. The final serological test (Case 33092) has come back negative, which is indicative of a recent infection. The case is a non-teaching staff and had been asymptomatic. Her close contacts have been placed under quarantine. In all, more than 39,000 preschool staff <sup>[2]</sup> have been tested so far, and only one case is likely to be a current infection.<br><br></span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><br>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; In the past week (22 May to 28 May), MOH has uncovered links for 2 previously unlinked cases. <br><br></span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\">7. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

Ms Tan also strengthened the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) training programme to better equip expert nurses with advanced clinical skills to manage patients with complex needs. To strengthen nursing in the community, she worked with the nurse leaders to implement the Regional Health System (RHS)-led Community Nursing pilots across the three clusters in October 2017.
