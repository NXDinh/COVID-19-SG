754 More Cases Discharged; 463 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed



754 MORE CASES DISCHARGED; 463 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 12 Jun 2020

                As of 12 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
has confirmed and verified an additional 463 cases of COVID-19 infection
in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
  A)   IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
  B)   CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 18 (8 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 2
Work Pass holders, 8 Work Permit holders)
Of the 18 cases in the community, 11 had been picked up as a result of
our proactive surveillance and screening, and 6 had already been placed
on quarantine.
Amongst the 8 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 6 had been tested as
part of our proactive surveillance of persons who work at dormitories.
Of these, 4 are asymptomatic. 1 (Case 39732) had been identified as a
close contact of previously confirmed cases, and had already been placed
on quarantine earlier. He was asymptomatic, and had been swabbed during
quarantine to verify his status. Epidemiological investigations are
ongoing for the remaining case (Case 39808).
Amongst the 10 Work Pass/ Work Permit holders, 3 (Cases 39581, 39582
and 39600) had been detected due to our proactive surveillance of
persons working at dormitories, even though they are all asymptomatic. 2
cases (Case 39450 and 39852) were swabbed as part of our efforts to
screen workers in essential services. 5 other cases were close contacts
of previously confirmed cases, and had already been quarantined at
government quarantine facilities. They are asymptomatic, and had been
swabbed during quarantine to verify their status.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections.[1] The serological test results of 4 cases (Cases
39729, 39732, 39859 and 39882) have come back positive, which indicate
likely past infections. Results are pending for the rest.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 6 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 9 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to
an average of 4 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our
active surveillance and screening of targeted groups, which have picked
up more cases in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor
these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance
programme.
  C)   CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 445
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.            Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.            Of the new cases, 98% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.
4.           MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the dormitory
at 50A Tuas Link 4 for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days),
the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.           In the past week (5 June to 11 June), MOH has uncovered
links for 11 previously unlinked cases.
6.           Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.           754 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 28,040 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.
8.           There are currently 239 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 2 are in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 11,546 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 25 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
