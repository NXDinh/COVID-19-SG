         Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong attended the 73rd World
Health Assembly (WHA), held on 18 May 2020.
2.       This is the first time the annual WHA was held virtually. It
took on an abridged agenda prepared by the Executive Board to cover only
essential matters of the World Health Organization (WHO), in order to
focus on the global COVID-19 pandemic response.
3.        The attendees comprised Health Ministers of the WHO Member
States, the WHO Director-General, Regional-Directors of the six WHO
Regions, and senior officials from the WHO.
4.          Mr Gan shared that Singapore’s circuit breaker measures have
delivered promising results, with fewer new cases in the community. The
situation in our migrant worker dormitories has also stabilised. As
Member States make plans to gradually resume normalcy, Mr Gan
highlighted the importance of adopting a cautious approach towards
lifting public health measures in a safe manner.
5.      Mr Gan highlighted the need for unity and cooperation amongst
the international community in the fight against COVID-19. Mr Gan
expressed appreciation to the WHO for their leadership and expertise in
the global response, and emphasised the importance of continuity in
addressing health priorities under the Sustainable Development Goals,
even as Member States address the immediate challenges of the pandemic.
6.        The transcript of Mr Gan’s remarks is enclosed.
