327 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 383 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 07 Jun 2020

         As of 7 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 383 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 14 (10 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1
Student Pass holder, 1 Work Pass holder, 2 Work Permit holders)
Of the 14 cases in the community, 11 were proactively screened as part
of our surveillance and active case finding to identify cases early and
isolate them.
Amongst the 10 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 5 were picked up as a
result of our proactive testing of school staff and students [1] above
the age of 12 diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first
presentation to a doctor. The epidemiological evidence suggests that
these cases were likely to have been infected during the Circuit Breaker
period, and not after school re-opening. 3 other cases (Cases 37940,
37941 and 37945) were tested as they had prolonged ARI symptoms. Another
case (Case 37754) was swabbed as part of our efforts to screen workers
in essential services. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for
the remaining case.
All 4 Student/ Work Pass/ Work Permit holders had been picked up as a
result of proactive screening. 1 (Case 37937) is a student at Ascensia
International School and was tested as part of our screening of students
with ARI. 2 (Cases 37746 and 37747) were contacts of previously
confirmed cases, and had already been quarantined in government
quarantine facilities earlier. The remaining case (Case 37755) was
tested as part of our proactive screening of workers in essential
services.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 8 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 4 per day in the past two weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 369
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 96% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.       MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Northpoint City
(930 Yishun Avenue 2) and the dormitory at 133 Tuas View Square for the
past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been
closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.      In the past week (31 May to 6 June), MOH has uncovered links for
5 previously unlinked cases.
6.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.      327 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 24,886 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.         There are currently 295 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 3 are in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 12,704 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 25 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
