927 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 642 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 23 May 2020

    As of 23 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed
and verified an additional 642 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore.
The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 11 (6 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 3
Work Pass holders, 2 Work Permit holders)
The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average
of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the
past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also
increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an
average of 2 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our active
surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school
staff, which have picked up more cases in the past week. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 631
We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.     Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.     MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Tuas South
Incineration Plant (98 Tuas South Avenue 3) and 234A Balestier Road for
the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now
been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.     In the past week (16 May to 22 May), MOH has uncovered links for
6 previously unlinked cases.
6.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.     927 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 13,882 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.     There are currently 711 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and eight are in
critical condition in the intensive care unit. 16,452 are isolated and
cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild
symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19.
23 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
