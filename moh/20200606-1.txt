               As of 6 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 344 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
  A)   IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
  B)   CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 7 (3 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 4
Work Permit holders)
Of the 7 cases in the community, 5 are asymptomatic, but we had swabbed
them as part of our proactive surveillance and screening.
Amongst the 3 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 (Case 37304) is a
family member of a previously confirmed case, and had already been
quarantined earlier. Another (Case 37553) is a cleaner at the preschool
section of an international school, and was tested as part our proactive
screening of preschool staff. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing
for the remaining case (Case 37515).
All 4 Work Permit holders had been picked up as a result of proactive
screening. Of these, 3 (Cases 37225, 37425 and 37426) were tested as
part of our efforts to screen workers in essential services, and 1 (Case
37514) was tested as part of our screening of migrant workers deployed
at public healthcare institutions. He had been doing building
maintenance works at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and had not interacted with
hospital staff or patients.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
  C)   CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 337
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.

further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the
construction site at 15 Serangoon North Avenue 1 for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.

links for 7 previously unlinked cases.
6.               Further epidemiological investigations and contact
