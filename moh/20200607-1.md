    <body><h1>383 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection (7 June 2020)</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 07 Jun 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 7 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 383 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there are 14 cases in the community, of whom 10 are Singaporeans/Permanent Residents and 4 are Work/Student Pass holders.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amongst the 14 cases, 9 were proactively screened as part of our active case finding to identify cases early and isolate them. Of these, 6 were picked up as a result of our proactive testing of school staff and students [1] above the age of 12 diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. The epidemiological evidence suggests that these cases were likely to have been infected during the Circuit Breaker period, and not after school re-opening. The other 3 cases were tested as they had prolonged ARI symptoms. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining cases.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>7 JUNE 2020<br><br></strong>[1] They are from Anglican High School, CHIJ Katong Convent, CHIJ St. Theresaâ€™s Convent, Geylang Methodist Secondary School, Hwa Chong Institution and Ascensia International School.</p></body>
