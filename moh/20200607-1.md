    <body><h1>327 More Cases Discharged, 383 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 07 Jun 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 7 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 383 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 0<br></strong><br>There are no imported cases today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 14 </strong>(10 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 Student Pass holder, 1 Work Pass holder, 2 Work Permit holders)<br><br>Of the 14 cases in the community, 11 were proactively screened as part of our surveillance and active case finding to identify cases early and isolate them.&nbsp;<br><br>Amongst the 10 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 5 were picked up as a result of our proactive testing of school staff and students [1] above the age of 12 diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. The epidemiological evidence suggests that these cases were likely to have been infected during the Circuit Breaker period, and not after school re-opening. 3 other cases (Cases 37940, 37941 and 37945) were tested as they had prolonged ARI symptoms. Another case (Case 37754) was swabbed as part of our efforts to screen workers in essential services. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining case.&nbsp;<br><br>All 4 Student/ Work Pass/ Work Permit holders had been picked up as a result of proactive screening. 1 (Case 37937) is a student at Ascensia International School and was tested as part of our screening of students with ARI. 2 (Cases 37746 and 37747) were contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had already been quarantined in government quarantine facilities earlier. The remaining case (Case 37755) was tested as part of our proactive screening of workers in essential services.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 8 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 4 per day in the past two weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 369<br></strong><br>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

As there have been no more cases linked to Northpoint City (930 Yishun Avenue 2) and the dormitory at 133 Tuas View Square for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the past week (31 May to 6 June), MOH has uncovered links for 5 previously unlinked cases.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
