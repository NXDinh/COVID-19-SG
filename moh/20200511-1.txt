504 MORE CASES DISCHARGED; 486 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 11 May 2020

                 As of 11 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
has confirmed and verified an additional 486 cases of COVID-19 infection
in Singapore. The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer
tests being processed at a testing laboratory as it is recalibrating its
apparatus for one of the test kits. The breakdown is as follows:
  A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
  B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3 (2 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1
Work Pass)
The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average
of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 8 per day in the
past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also
decreased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an
average of 3 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
  C) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING OUTSIDE DORMITORIES): 2
The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside
dormitories has decreased, from an average of 9 cases per day in the
week before, to an average of 8 per day in the past week.
  D) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING IN DORMITORIES): 481

We continue to pick up many more cases amongst Work Permit holders
residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories,
because of extensive testing in these premises.

[1] Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the
primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will
be added to the COVID-19 death count. This is consistent with
international practice for classifying deaths. In 2018, 86 male foreign
workers aged 25 to 59 passed away due to heart disease in Singapore.
