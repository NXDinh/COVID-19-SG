486 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 11 May 2020

                    As of 11 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health
(MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 486 cases of COVID-19
infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit
holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. Two cases are
Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents.
2.               The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer
tests being processed at a testing laboratory as it is recalibrating its
apparatus for one of the test kits.
3.               We are still working through the details of the cases,
and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will
be issued tonight.
