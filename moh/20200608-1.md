The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our active surveillance and screening of targeted groups, which have picked up more cases in the past week <sup>[1]</sup>. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><br><strong>c)&nbsp;Cases residing in dormitories: 384</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><br>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><br>2. &nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a title="" href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
