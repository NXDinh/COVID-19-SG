1,096 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 506 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 30 May 2020

         As of 30 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 506 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 5 (2 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 Work
Pass holder, 2 Work Permit holders)
Amongst the 2 SC/PR cases today, 1 is a non-teaching preschool staff who
was picked up as a result of our proactive screening to prepare for the
phased reopening of preschools. MOH will conduct a serological test to
determine if this was a past or current infection. The other case is
currently unlinked.
Amongst the 3 Work Pass and Work Permit holders, 1 was a contact of
previous confirmed cases, and had already been placed on quarantine
earlier. Another was tested before he was due to start work on a
plumbing project at a preschool. Epidemiological investigations are
ongoing for the remaining case.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 7 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 501
We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.       Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.        MOH has looked into the cases of three Prisons inmates (Cases
8650, 11178 and 23195) and one staff nurse from Singapore Prison
Service’s medical service provider (Case 11927) who had earlier tested
positive for COVID-19. We have established that they were not
epidemiologically linked to one another, and did not constitute a
cluster. The cases had been included earlier in our daily updates on new
COVID cases.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.      In the past week (23 May to 29 May), MOH has uncovered links for
1 previously unlinked case.
6.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.      1,096 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 20,727 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.       There are currently 374 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 7 are in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 13,242 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 23 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
