    <body><h1>994 More Cases Discharged, 548 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 24 May 2020</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of 24 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 548 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows: </p><p><strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imported cases: 0</strong></p><p>There are no imported cases today. </p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases in the community: 4</strong> (3 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 Work Permit holder)</p><p>The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 6 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our active surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school staff, which have picked up more cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.</p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 544</strong></p><p>We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a title="" href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1590417383413000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGuCEthE-xLZQI2NtgUpuWSdnPP9A">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/<wbr>situation-report</a>).
