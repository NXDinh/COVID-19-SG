482 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 386 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 08 Jun 2020

    As of 8 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed
and verified an additional 386 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore.
The breakdown is as follows:

A) IMPORTED CASES: 0

There are no imported cases today.

B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2 (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Pass holder)

Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the 2 cases in the
community today. Both were symptomatic, and had been tested after
seeking medical treatment at Public Health Preparedness Clinics.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 9 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 4 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our
active surveillance and screening of targeted groups, which have picked
up more cases in the past week [1]. We will continue to closely monitor
these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance
programme.

C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 384

We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
