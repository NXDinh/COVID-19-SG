Published Date: 14 Jun 2020

       As of 14 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 407 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 1
There is an imported case today involving a Bangladeshi national who
arrived in Singapore on 10 June to seek medical treatment that is not
related to COVID-19 infection. His health declaration submitted before
immigration clearance indicated he did not have any COVID-19 symptoms,
and had not been diagnosed or suspected to have COVID-19 infection. He
was placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore, and could only
leave his designated place of residence for medical consultation and
follow-up. He was subsequently tested for COVID-19 after arrival in
Singapore and his results came back positive on 13 June. Contact tracing
is ongoing, and identified close contacts have been placed on
quarantine.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 9 (4 Singaporeans, 1 Work Pass holder, 4 Work
Permit holders)
Of the 9 cases in the community, 8 had been picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on
quarantine.
Amongst the 4 Singaporean cases, 3 (Cases 40268, 40479 and 40480) were
detected due to our proactive surveillance of persons working at
dormitories, even though 2 of them (Cases 40268 and 40480) are
asymptomatic. The remaining case (Case 40571) is a family member of a
previously confirmed case, and had already been quarantined earlier. He
is asymptomatic, and had been swabbed during quarantine to verify his
status.
All 5 Work Pass/ Work Permit holders were picked up as a result of our
proactive screening. 2 of them (Cases 40269 and 40478) work at
dormitories, and were swabbed as part of our surveillance. The remaining
three (Cases 40558, 40559 and 40560) were tested as part of our efforts
to screen workers in essential services.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 8 per day in the past two weeks. The number of unlinked
cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of 8 per
day in the past two weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these
numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance
programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 397
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.      We announced yesterday that a student at St Anthony’s Canossian
Secondary School has tested positive for COVID-19. As a precaution, 47
students and 12 staff who had been in close contact with the student
have been put on Leave of Absence by the Ministry of Education or Home
Quarantine Order by MOH. All 47 students have been tested for COVID-19,
and their test results have all come back negative. The results for the
staff are pending.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.       In the past week (7 June to 13 June), MOH has uncovered links
for 13 previously unlinked cases.
6.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.      781 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 29,589 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.         There are currently 238 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 2 are in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 10,751 are isolated and cared for
