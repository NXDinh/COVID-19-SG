    <body><h1>927 More Cases Discharged, 642 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 23 May 2020</p> <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As of 23 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 642 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>a)&nbsp;Imported cases: 0<br></strong><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">There are no imported cases today.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>b)&nbsp;Cases in the community: 11</strong> (6 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 3 Work Pass holders, 2 Work Permit holders)<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our active surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school staff, which have picked up more cases in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>c)&nbsp;Cases residing in dormitories: 631<br></strong><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers. <br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).

As there have been no more cases linked to Tuas South Incineration Plant (98 Tuas South Avenue 3) and 234A Balestier Road for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.<br><br><strong></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Links between previous cases found<br></strong><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">5. &nbsp; &nbsp; In the past week (16 May to 22 May), MOH has uncovered links for 6 previously unlinked cases. <br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">6. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
