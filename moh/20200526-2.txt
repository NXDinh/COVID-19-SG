Published Date: 26 May 2020

          As of 26 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed an additional 383 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in
foreign worker dormitories. There is one Singaporean/ Permanent Resident
case. The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests being
conducted.
2.     We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
