    <body><h1>1,096 More Cases Discharged, 506 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed </h1>
    <p>Published Date: 30 May 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 30 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 506 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 0</strong><br><br>There are no imported cases today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 5 </strong>(2 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 Work Pass holder, 2 Work Permit holders)<br><br>Amongst the 2 SC/PR cases today, 1 is a non-teaching preschool staff who was picked up as a result of our proactive screening to prepare for the phased reopening of preschools. MOH will conduct a serological test to determine if this was a past or current infection. The other case is currently unlinked.&nbsp;<br><br>Amongst the 3 Work Pass and Work Permit holders, 1 was a contact of previous confirmed cases, and had already been placed on quarantine earlier. Another was tested before he was due to start work on a plumbing project at a preschool. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining case.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 7 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 501<br></strong><br>We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

We have established that they were not epidemiologically linked to one another, and did not constitute a cluster. The cases had been included earlier in our daily updates on new COVID cases.<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the past week (23 May to 29 May), MOH has uncovered links for 1 previously unlinked case.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
