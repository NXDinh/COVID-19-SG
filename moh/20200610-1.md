    <body><h1>655 More Cases Discharged; 451 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 10 Jun 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 10 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 451 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows: </p> <p><strong>a) Imported cases: 0<br></strong>There are no imported cases today.</p><p><p><strong>b) Cases in the community: 7 </strong>(3 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 Work Pass holder, 3 Work Permit holders)<br><br>Of the 7 cases in the community, 2 had already been quarantined and 4 were proactively screened as part of our surveillance and active case finding to identify cases early and isolate them.</p></p><p><p>Amongst the 3 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 (Case 38555) is a household contact of a previously confirmed case, and had already been quarantined. Another (Case 38741) is a security guard at a dormitory at 31 Sungei Kadut Avenue, and was proactively tested as part of our screening of persons working at dormitories. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining case (Case 38697).</p><p>All 4 Work Pass/ Work Permit holders are asymptomatic but we had detected them from our active surveillance and screening. Amongst them, 2 (Cases 38632 and 38857) were tested due to our proactive screening of workers in essential services, and another (Case 38633) was swabbed as he works as a security guard at Hai Leck Engineering Pte Ltd&nbsp; (12 Tuas Drive 1), an active cluster. The remaining case (Case 38635) is a housemate of previously confirmed cases, and had already been quarantined in a government quarantine facility earlier. He was swabbed during quarantine to verify his status.</p><p>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 9 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per day in the past week.&nbsp;This is partly due to our active surveillance and screening of targeted groups, which have picked up more cases in the past week [1]. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.</p><p><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 444<br></strong>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.</p></p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

All 6 cases had displayed mild symptoms, with low viral loads. A repeat test using new samples showed that all the cases were negative. All of them have since recovered and 5 have been discharged from hospital. The remaining case is medically fit for discharge, but remains in hospital pending resolution of administrative issues. <br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Health Sciences Authority, in consultation with its Medicines Advisory Committee, has granted conditional approval for Gilead Sciences Singapore Pte Ltd’s Veklury® (remdesivir) today, after an expedited review. Singapore is among the earliest countries to grant an approval for the medicine. MOH is working with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on developing guidelines for the appropriate use of the drug in healthcare institutions, and identifying the patients who are likely to benefit most from this medicine.</p></p><p><p><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></p><p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the past week (3 June to 9 June), MOH has uncovered links for 4 previously unlinked cases. <br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
