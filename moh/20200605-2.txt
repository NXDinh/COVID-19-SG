261 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 05 Jun 2020

  As of 5 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed an additional 261 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in
foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there
are 11 cases in the community, of whom 6 are Singaporeans/Permanent
Residents and 5 are Work Pass holders. The lower number of cases today
is partly due to fewer swabs being conducted.

2.  Amongst the 11 cases, 6 are linked to previously confirmed
cases, and had already been placed on quarantine, and 1 is linked to a
dormitory cluster. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the
remaining 4.

3.  We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
