    <p>Published Date: 31 May 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 31 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 518 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows: </p> <p><strong>a) Imported cases: 0</strong></p><p><p>There are no imported cases today.</p><p><strong>b) Cases in the community: 2 </strong>(2 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents [1])</p></p><p><p>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the 2 community cases today, both of whom are currently unlinked.</p><p>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 6 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.</p><p><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 516</strong></p></p> <p>We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.</p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

As there have been no more cases linked to the Institute of Mental Health (10 Buangkok View) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed. <br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MOH has been undertaking surveillance tests in nursing homes to allow us to detect any infections in the homes as early as possible. We have completed one round of surveillance swab tests for all nursing home staff and residents on 8 May and 30 May respectively. Out of about 13,200 residents who were tested, all results were negative except for 4 residents of Orange Valley Nursing Home, as announced on 21 May. Out of about 9,000 nursing home staff, only one from Ren Ci @ Ang Mo Kio had tested positive, as announced on 8 May.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found&nbsp;<br><br></strong>6<strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>In the past week (24 May to 30 May), MOH has uncovered links for 2 previously unlinked cases. <br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
