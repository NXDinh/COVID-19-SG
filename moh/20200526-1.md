    <body><h1>706 More Cases Discharged, 383 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 26 May 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 26 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 383 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests being conducted. The breakdown is as follows:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 0<br></strong><br>There are no imported cases today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 2</strong> (1 Singaporean/Permanent Resident, 1 Work Permit holder)<br><br>The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our active surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school staff, which have picked up more cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 381</strong><br><br>We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
