910 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 448 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 21 May 2020

         As of 21 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 448 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY[1]:__ 14 (13 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents,
1 Work Permit holder)
The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average
of 7 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 6 per day in the
past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained
stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.
Of the 13 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents cases, 7 cases were picked
up as a result of our active surveillance and screening of nursing home
residents and pre-school staff, and four are part of a family cluster
linked to a dormitory. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for
the remaining two cases.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 434
We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.       Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.        MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Natureland East
Coast (907 East Coast Road), Wing Fong Court (10 Lorong 14 Geylang) and
112 Neythal Road  for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days),
the clusters have now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.        In the past week (14 May to 20 May), MOH has uncovered links
for 6 previously unlinked cases.
6.      Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.      910 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 12,117 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.         There are currently 901 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 10 are in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 16,771 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 23 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
9.    Case 4689, a 73 year-old male Singapore Citizen, has passed away
from complications due to COVID-19 infection on 21 May 2020. He was
confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 17 April, and had a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and hypothyroidism. The National Centre
for Infectious Diseases has reached out to his family and is extending
assistance to them.

21 MAY 2020
[1] Previously we had tracked the work permit holders living outside
dormitories as a separate category, and put a large number of these
workers on Stay Home Notices (SHN). The SHN for these workers has since
expired. Hence we have now updated the definition of “Cases in the
Community” to include all cases (including amongst Work Permit holders)
who are detected outside of the dormitories.
