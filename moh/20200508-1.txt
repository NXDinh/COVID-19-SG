We continue to pick up many more cases amongst Work Permit holders
residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories,
because of extensive testing in these premises.

International School (301 Dover Road), ICA Building (10 Kallang Road)
and Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home (1 Thomson Lane) for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.
