    <p>Published Date: 25 May 2020</p> <p>As of 25 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 344 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. Four cases are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents. The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests being conducted.&nbsp; <br><br>We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.</p></body>
