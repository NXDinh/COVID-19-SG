The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks.

One more serological test has come back positive today, indicating a likely past infection. In all, more than 39,000 preschool staff <sup>[2]</sup> have been tested, and only one case was likely to be a current infection at the point of screening, as announced on 29 May. </span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><br><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><br>6. &nbsp;&nbsp; In the past week (27 May to 2 June), MOH has uncovered links for 7 previously unlinked cases. </span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;\"><br>7. &nbsp; &nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
