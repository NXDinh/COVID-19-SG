626 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 884 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 12 May 2020

    As of 12 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed
and verified an additional 884 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore.
The breakdown is as follows:

A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 4 (3 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 Work
Pass)
The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average
of 8 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the
past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also
decreased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an
average of 3 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

C) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING OUTSIDE DORMITORIES): 3
The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside
dormitories has decreased, from an average of 7 cases per day in the
week before, to an average of 6 per day in the past week.

D) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING IN DORMITORIES): 877

The number of new cases from the testing of workers with acute
respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms and their contacts remains stable.
But the number of daily cases continues to rise as we are also testing
the workers who are well and asymptomatic, as part of our process to
verify and test the status of every worker. We had started this
intensive testing at the purpose-built dormitories, and are now doing so
for the factory-converted dormitories.
