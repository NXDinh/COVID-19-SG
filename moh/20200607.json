Based on our investigations so far, there are 14 cases in the community, of whom 10 are Singaporeans/Permanent Residents and 4 are Work/Student Pass holders.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amongst the 14 cases, 9 were proactively screened as part of our active case finding to identify cases early and isolate them. Of these, 6 were picked up as a result of our proactive testing of school staff and students [1] above the age of 12 diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. The epidemiological evidence suggests that these cases were likely to have been infected during the Circuit Breaker period, and not after school re-opening. The other 3 cases were tested as they had prolonged ARI symptoms. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining cases.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>7 JUNE 2020<br><br></strong>[1] They are from Anglican High School, CHIJ Katong Convent, CHIJ St. Theresa\u2019s Convent, Geylang Methodist Secondary School, Hwa Chong Institution and Ascensia International School.</p>", "PressCategory": ["Highlights", "Press Releases"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "383-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-(7-june-2020)", "CurrentPageUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
