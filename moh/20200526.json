The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests being conducted. The breakdown is as follows:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 0<br></strong><br>There are no imported cases today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 2</strong> (1 Singaporean/Permanent Resident, 1 Work Permit holder)<br><br>The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the past week. This is partly due to our active surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school staff, which have picked up more cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 381</strong><br><br>We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br>2.
