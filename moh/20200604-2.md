As of 4 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 517 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there are 15 cases in the community, of whom two are Singaporeans/Permanent Residents and 13 are Work Pass holders. All 15 cases were close contacts of earlier confirmed cases, and had already been placed on quarantine. They are all asymptomatic, but we had swabbed them to confirm and verify their status.
