Roadmap Ahead to Phase Two



ROADMAP AHEAD TO PHASE TWO


Published Date: 28 May 2020

      Singapore will be exiting the Circuit Breaker and embarking on
Phase One of re-opening on 2 June 2020. We expect more than three
quarters of the economy to resume operations by then. The Multi-Ministry
Taskforce will carefully monitor the effects of increased activity in
this phase. If the community infection rates remain low and stable over
the subsequent two weeks, we can decide by the middle of June to proceed
with Phase Two, which could then happen before the end of June.
PLANS FOR PHASE TWO
2.     Phase Two will entail the resumption of a broader range of
activities. We expect almost the entire economy to re-open, subject to
safe management measures being in place. This broader re-opening will
see the resumption of the following:
3.       RETAIL, F&B, AND OTHER SERVICES. Most business activities will
be allowed to resume operations in Phase Two, subject to safe management
measures, group size and capacity limits being met. These businesses
include retail, food and beverage dine-in, personal health and wellness,
as well as home-based services. Sports and other public facilities, e.g.
stadia, swimming pools, will be opened too. Further details on
sector-specific safe management measures will be provided by relevant
agencies closer to the start of Phase Two.
4.    We will adopt a more cautious approach for higher-risk activities.
These typically involve large numbers of people interacting with one
another, often in enclosed spaces, and for prolonged periods of time.
Overseas and local experience has indicated that these settings can seed
large clusters of infected persons. Such activities include:
a. Religious services and congregations;
b. Cultural venues such as art galleries, libraries and museums;
c. Large-scale events and venues, such as conferences, exhibitions,
concerts and trade fairs; and
d. Entertainment venues such as bars, nightclubs, karaoke outlets,
cinemas, theatres, and other indoor and outdoor attractions.
5.      For such activities, the relevant government agencies will be
engaging businesses and organisations on how they might resume safely,
with the necessary safe management measures and safeguards needed.
Subject to the appropriate measures being in place, we will discuss with
these entities the timing of when they can resume activities in Phase
Two.
6.   SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND FAMILY VISITS. Under Phase Two, masks will
remain compulsory whenever outside oneâ€™s home. Small-group social
gatherings of up to five persons will be allowed. Within the home,
households may receive up to five visitors per day.
7.     As seniors are especially vulnerable, they should continue to
exercise extra caution and stay at home as much as possible. We
recognise that this can be challenging, especially for seniors with care
and/or psychosocial needs. To better support them and their caregivers,
more senior services and programmes (e.g. senior care centres) will
resume with the appropriate safe management measures in place. Some
face-to-face social services for other vulnerable groups will resume
with safe management measures.
8.     SCHOOLS. As announced on 19 May 2020, schools will fully re-open
from end June, while Institutes of Higher Learning will gradually
increase the number of students back on campus at any one time for
face-to-face learning.
9.      We have provided a broad overview of the timeline leading up to
Phase Two and the likely easing of measures that will take place.
Depending on the COVID-19 situation and our risk assessment, we will
continue to ease measures (e.g. on the size of gatherings) gradually
until we reach a new normal in Phase Three, a state in which we expect
to remain until an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is
developed.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IS KEY
10.   Phase Two is a significant step in transiting to a new COVID-safe
normal. As restrictions are eased, it becomes even more critical that
each of us exercises social responsibility to ensure that community
transmission remains low as we resume more activities. As we have seen
both locally and overseas, it takes only a single person acting
irresponsibly to cause a cluster. We need everyone to play their part,
observe good personal hygiene, adhere to safe management measures, and
avoid crowded places. Employers and employees will need to continue
implementing safe management measures and act in a responsible manner at
all times.
11.    We can look forward to moving to Phase Two and beyond if each of
us plays our part. Together, we can and we must achieve a COVID-safe
Singapore.
