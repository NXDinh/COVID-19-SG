706 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 383 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 26 May 2020

         As of 26 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 383 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer tests
being conducted. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2 (1 Singaporean/Permanent Resident, 1 Work
Permit holder)
The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average
of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the
past week. This is partly due to our active surveillance and screening
of nursing home residents and pre-school staff, which have picked up
more cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the
community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two
weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the
cases detected through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 381
We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
