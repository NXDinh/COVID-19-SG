994 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 548 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 24 May 2020

  As of 24 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 548 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

A)  IMPORTED CASES: 0

There are no imported cases today.

B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 4 (3 Singaporeans/Permanent
Residents, 1 Work Permit holder)

The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average
of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 6 per day in the
past week. This is partly due to our active surveillance and screening
of nursing home residents and pre-school staff, which have picked up
more cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the
community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two
weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the
cases detected through our surveillance programme.

C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 544

We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.  Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.

4.  MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Strand Hotel
(25 Bencoolen Street) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28
days), the cluster has now been closed.



LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

5.  In the past week (17 May to 23 May), MOH has uncovered
links for 5 previously unlinked cases.

6.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.



UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

7.  994 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 14,876 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

8.  There are currently 690 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 8 are in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 16,027 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 23 have passed
