The lower number of cases today is partly due to fewer swabs being conducted. The breakdown is as follows: </p><p><strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imported cases: 0</strong></p><p>There are no imported cases today. </p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases in the community: 11 </strong>(6 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 5 Work Permit holders)</p><p>Of the 11 cases in the community, 8 are asymptomatic, but we had swabbed them as part of our proactive surveillance or to verify their status during quarantine. </p><p>Amongst the 6 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 5 are linked to previously confirmed cases, and had already been placed on quarantine. 1 is a Permanent Resident who stays at Cassia @ Penjuru dormitory, and was proactively tested as part of our efforts to clear the dormitories.&nbsp; </p><p>Amongst the 5 Work Permit holders, 4 had been picked up as a result of our proactive screening. Of these, 3 were tested before they are due to start work in essential services, and 1 was tested as part of our screening of migrant workers residing at shophouses located at Balestier Road, due to their proximity to another cluster in the same area. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining case. </p><p>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we also conducted serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or past infections.&nbsp; The serological test results of 3 cases (Cases 36970, 36971 and 36973) have come back positive, which indicate likely past infections. Results are pending for the rest. </p><p>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 6 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.</p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 250</strong></p><p>We continue to pick up many cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591453159896000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1q1pDzav4YJGgzSS6rBzxU\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/<wbr>situation-report</a>).
