She instituted the Advanced Clinical Education nursing programmes to equip nurses with broad-based skills and knowledge to manage patients across care settings, in line with the needs of an ageing population. Ms Tan also strengthened the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) training programme to better equip expert nurses with advanced clinical skills to manage patients with complex needs. To strengthen nursing in the community, she worked with the nurse leaders to implement the Regional Health System (RHS)-led Community Nursing pilots across the three clusters in October 2017. In addition, she oversaw the development and completion of the Community Nursing Competency Framework and Training Roadmap.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A highly respected figure in the nursing profession, Ms Tan was awarded the Public Administration Medal (Silver) in 2017 for her outstanding contributions towards the improvement of our healthcare system.<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ms Paulin Koh is the Chief Nurse at Changi General Hospital (CGH) and the Deputy Group Chief Nurse of SingHealth. Ms Koh was appointed as CNO-Designate in MOH from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2020.&nbsp; Ms Koh has been a key driver for Community Nursing at CGH to extend its reach beyond the hospital and into the community.&nbsp; As a member of various MOH and Singapore Nursing Board committees, Ms Koh has contributed towards elevating the nursing profession in Singapore and has shaped policies and strategies to enhance nursing practice, education and career.&nbsp; Ms Koh’s professionalism, drive for high standards of patient safety and services and close linkage with the ground will provide her with a strong foundation to advance the nursing profession in Singapore.&nbsp;<br></span><div><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br></span></div></body>
